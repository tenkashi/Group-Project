      <p><font size="5">Species include wild horse, wild donkey[verification needed], camel, and reindeer, as well as draft horse breeds, small horse breeds and donkeys. Oxen and draft horses have traditionally been used for pulling loads. Note that dogs too were used to pull people on snow sleds, but can not be used appropriatelly as it's not a main species (ancestor:gray wolf), and also principally consume meat (hence making them unsuitable for use on grasslands).<br><br> <br> 
        Some of these animals can be ridden. By using a saddle, a person can sit directly on the animal. This has advantages for certain contexts, particularly for travelling on rough terrain. It however also has the disadvantage that the animal needs to carry the full weight of the person, and thus needs to perform considerably more effort to transport the person.

Note that the animals can often also be used as pack animals (carrying cargo rather than a person on the back), see the "Working_animal" wikipedia article. This again is more suitable on rough terrain.<br>
<br>
Carts (coaches, stagecoaches, ...) can be used to considerably reduce the effort needed to transport 1 (or several) persons by means of animal power. They have the disadvantage though that due to the use of wheels, the terrain needs to be flat (preferably paved). Another disadvantage is that the weight of the cart itself is of course also added, though the effort for the animal is still a lot lower since the weight actually rests on the ground, and the animal only has to pull it forward (rather than also supporting it). The cart used is best kept as lightweight as possible, while keeping them sturdy (ie by using metal, ...). Sulkies seem to be the lightest carts.<br> <br>
