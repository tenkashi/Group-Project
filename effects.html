Moreover, passengers should do bike and carpool. So that the passengers can reach the same destination by less consumption of fuel. Also, it will save energy as they can drive the car or bike in shifts.<br>

    Furthermore, the person should turn off the ignition on the red signals. This, in turn, will save fuel and money.<br>  At the same time, minor changes in driving like- driving the vehicle on economic speed, apply fewer brakes, reducing quick acceleration can save your fuel and your vehicle will also remain in good condition.<br> Quality checks of the vehicles can also reduce fuel consumption and increase performance.
    
    Above all, the government is taking some major steps to minimize pollution.<br> Electric buses and trains run in the entire city to reduce the use of diesel buses as public transport. Furthermore, the installation of CNG( Compressed Natural Gas) engines is mandatory. This would reduce the cost of transportation and will not be harmful to the environment.
    
    Recently, electric cars and bikes came into the market. This will reduce fuel consumption for personal transport and will be environment-friendly.<br>
    These were all the measures that will significantly help in the reduction of vehicle pollution.<br> <br>
