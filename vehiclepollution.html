Moreover, every work needs a vehicle for transportation. Without them, our work would be very difficult. It saves us time and also reduces our energy consumption in traveling from one place to another. <br> <br> 
    A vehicle needs fuel which is of two types- Diesel and petrol. These are the fossil fuels that are extracted from within the earth. Though a vehicle has so many benefits it is a major threat to the environment. Because it creates pollution which is increasing. And that is because of the increase in the number of vehicles.
    The fuel on which a vehicle runs gets burned inside the engine which in turn emits various harmful gases. The gases that vehicle emits are carbon monoxide, Nitrogen dioxide, Sulphur Oxide. All these gases are harmful to the environment.
    
    Furthermore, it hampers the health of a person to a dangerous extent. Carbon monoxide is poisonous. Due to which suffocation can occur in the lungs followed by difficulty in breathing. Also, these gases cause global warming. That is a major problem in this era. Furthermore, it causes the ozone layer depletion. Due to which ultraviolet rays can enter into our environment and can cause skin cancer.
    
    Apart from all the hazardous effects of vehicle pollution, the number of vehicles is increasing day by day. According to an estimation, there is an average of 2 vehicles in a single house. Some of the families have more than that. This is the root cause of the increase in the pollution of the vehicle.
    
    Because each member of the family is traveling alone on a two-seater or four-seater vehicle. Thus the consumption of the fuel becomes double. There are various measures by which there can be a reduction of vehicle pollution </font></body><br> <br>
